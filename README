This Python library relies on the python rest client library
from https://github.com/bmjames/python-rest-client.git
and the Python TAP unit testing library 
from https://github.com/rjbs/pytap.git

To avoid warnings in python-rest-client about deprecated MD5 and SHA hashing code,
install the newest version of httplib2 from
http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/downloads/list

dezi_client is a Python client for the Dezi search platform.
